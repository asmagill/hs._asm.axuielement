Long Term:

      revisit hs.uielement merger -- not happening in near term; uielement is being cleaned up and provides a simpler, safer interface to the basics; this module is for those who need/want more.

      move CGType <--> Lua conversion into LuaSkin (and move userdata conversions into appropriate modules)?
          allow extensions for CGTypeID?
              filter out built-ins to prevent module screwing with strings, etc.?
              although we don't check this for NSObjects, probably should...

      hs._coresetup/hs.logger modify LuaSkin delegate to check begining of string for "^hs.[%w_]+" and see if logger already exists
          if true, remove matched string and log to that logger
          if false, log to LuaSkinLog as currently done
