TODO:

Before Landing:

      matchesCriteria additions?
          match if action exists? (e.g. all elements with AXPress action)
          match if parameterizedAttribute exists?
          a way to specify *any* value for attribute
          a way to specify *not* for a specific key-value?
          a way to specify multiple criteria to be ANDed
              move isPattern into criteria table so can be different for each (also do this for elementSearch)

      elementSearch additions?
          a way to specify multiple criteria, ORed together (i.e. match at least one criteria table)?

      review docs

*     allattributeValues fails to capture existing attributes that return nil (NULL) or no-value -- this impacts:
*     allow `hs.axuielement.applicationElement` to take string and invoke `hs.application.find` if it's a string
*     allow `hs.axuielement.windowElement` to take string and invoke `hs.window.find` if it's a string
*     review NSAccessibilityConstants.h and see what it includes that AXAttributeConstants.h -- I've already found a few differences
 +    Add CGColor conversion support            -- gotta find one first
*         also converted to NSURL for CFURL
 +        and added CGImage/NSImage conversion) -- gotta find one first
*     Notifications/Observers?
*     test setAttributeValue more thoroughly
*     test getParameterizedAttributeValue more thoroughly

After landing

      Finish ParamaterizedAttribute notes
      retest examples given

Long Term:

      revisit hs.uielement merger -- not happening in near term; uielement is being cleaned up and provides a simpler, safer interface to the basics; this module is for those who need/want more.

      move CGType <--> Lua conversion into LuaSkin (and move userdata conversions into appropriate modules)?
          allow extensions for CGTypeID?
              filter out built-ins to prevent module screwing with strings, etc.?
              although we don't check this for NSObjects, probably should...

      hs._coresetup/hs.logger modify LuaSkin delegate to check begining of string for "^hs.[%w_]+" and see if logger already exists
          if true, remove matched string and log to that logger
          if false, log to LuaSkinLog as currently done
